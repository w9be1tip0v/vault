# Quickstart Workflows (Cursor-Assistant Rules)

These rules help the assistant scaffold notes and workflows consistently, based on the Quick Start Guide.

## Required Plugins and Setup
- Enable `Dataview` and `Templates`. `Obsidian Git` is optional.
- Templates folder location: `Starter-Kit/Templates`.

## When Creating Notes
- Use the appropriate template:
  - Literature: `2_Book Template`, `2_Person Template`, `2_Term Template`, etc.
  - Permanent: `3_Note Template` for independent ideas.
- Add tags at the bottom (not YAML): ensure at least `#type/*` and one `#theme/*`.
- Create 2+ links per new note using `[[Note Name]]`.
- Prefer short, skimmable sections and checklists.

## Starter Scaffolds

### Fleeting Note (seed)
```markdown
# Today's Ideas - {{date}}

## Things I thought of
-

## Things to research
-

## Questions
-

---
Tags: #type/fleeting #theme/learning
```

### Daily Routine Block
```markdown
## Daily Zettelkasten Time (15 minutes)

### Morning (5 minutes)
- [ ] Review yesterday's fleeting notes
- [ ] Note materials to read today

### Evening (10 minutes)
- [ ] Record today's ideas in 1_Fleeting
- [ ] Promote valuable ideas to 3_Permanent
- [ ] Note tomorrow's learning plan
```

## Linking Patterns
- Concept development: `[[Basic Concept]] → [[Applied Idea]] → [[Practice Method]]`
- Contrast: `[[Traditional Method]] ⚡ [[New Approach]]`
- Causal: `[[Cause]] → [[Effect]] → [[Solution]]`

## First Week Checklist
- Day 1–2: 3 fleeting, 1 literature, 5 links
- Day 3–4: 2 permanent, interlink notes, set tags appropriately
- Day 5–7: Weekly review, try Dataview, start customization

## Common Pitfalls (and fixes)
- Perfectionism → Aim for 80% and iterate
- No links → Always add at least two links per note
- Neglecting fleeting → Schedule 2 weekly reviews

## Growth Milestones
- 1 month: 50 notes / 100 links
- 3 months: 200 notes / 3–5 clusters
- 6 months: 500 notes / dense graph

## Assistant Behavior in Cursor
- Offer the appropriate template snippet for the current folder (e.g., `2_Literature`, `3_Permanent`).
- Validate tags: enforce `#type/*` and at least one `#theme/*`; keep tags at bottom.
- Suggest 2–3 internal links based on existing note titles.
- Offer a small end-of-note "Next Actions" checklist.
- When adding Dataview, prefer minimal, readable tables.
