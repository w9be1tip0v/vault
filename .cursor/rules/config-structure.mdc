# Configuration & Structure Rules (Cursor-Assistant)

Guide the assistant to keep the vault consistent with the defined structure.

## Folder Structure (must exist)
- `1_Fleeting/` – quick capture; review weekly
- `2_Literature/` – per-source notes (books, people, terms)
- `3_Permanent/` – independent ideas (one idea per note)
- `4_Project/` – per-project folders with `_MOC`, `Project Log`, `History`
- `5_Structure/` – indexes, glossary, MOCs, canvases

If missing, propose creating the folder and its `_About` or `_MOC` seed note.

## Naming & Templates
- Clear, concise filenames; one idea per note in `3_Permanent/`.
- Use templates:
  - Literature: `2_Book / 2_Person / 2_Term / 2_Tool / 2_Quote`
  - Permanent: `3_Note`, `3_Question`, `3_Prompt`
  - Structure/Project: `5_Structure`, `4_Post`, `5_Meeting`, `5_OKR`

## Tagging (see Tagging Rules)
- Enforce: at least one `#type/*` and one `#theme/*`.
- Place tags at the bottom, in a `Tags:` block when appropriate.

## Linking Strategy
- Create meaningful links; prefer 2+ links per note.
- Use section links `[[Note#Heading]]` and embeds `![[Note]]` when helpful.
- Maintain project MOCs in `4_Project/[Project]/_MOC - [Project].md`.

## Dataview Practices
- Prefer simple tables/lists; keep queries readable.
- Example (recent permanents):
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID file.link as "Recent Notes", (date(today) - file.cday).day as "Days Old"
FROM "3_Permanent"
SORT file.cday desc
LIMIT 10
```

## Homepage/Overview Ideas
- Random quote, recent activity, simple stats.

## Assistant Validation Checklist
Before finalizing an edit or a new note, verify:
- Folder matches note type
- Template applied (if relevant)
- Tags include `#type/*` and `#theme/*`, placed at bottom
- At least two internal links added
- If project-related, ensure or suggest MOC/log/history presence
